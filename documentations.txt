1) CodeChallenge is HTML and JS Separated from ASP.NET MVC To be easy finding codes.
2) UserLookUp is ASP.NET MVS project currently does same think but behaves better. (Has to run on the server.)

*********************************
Here is a key: 2e50796db7e235e0	*
*********************************

This API looking for users by email. Enter personal email to look up for someone interested.

Name of person, images, personal social sites(I made them clickable) and work background.

Before you start searching user, you must provide key for authorization on the server and lock it by clicking Lock button.

Key is limited. 100 matched user only. 

I can provide better functionality and design but due to key limits can't. I want to save some try for you.

Not all the returned data is used. There is a lot. This application may be a useful to look up candidates or others background. 

You can find 2 calls: $.ajax and javascript XMLHttpRequest. Both are functional, just replace comments.

I've tried many of my friends emails to enter but not all of them was provide enough information as my personal. 
you can try it as well: krevaz@gmail.com to see some layout and after try others.
